        <h2>How to play</h2>

        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>
            The playing board is composed of tiles that may or may not hide a bomb underneath. 
            The objective of the game is to find and reveal all the tiles that do not contain a bomb.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each tile once uncovered reveals the information on how many tiles adjacent to it contain a bomb. 
            This information is conveyed through a number written on the tile. 
            "Adjacent tile" means any one of the 8 tiles surrounding a given tile. 
            If an uncovered tile doesn't have a number then none of the adjacent tiles hide a bomb.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to aid yourself with remembering which tiles certainly contain a bomb you can flag a tile.
            A flagged tile is displayed with "F" written on top of it. Flagging a tile also decreases the "Bombs left" counter.
            Uncovering an already uncovered tile if around it there are at least as many flagged tiles as the number on this tile suggests,
            reveals all the adjacent tiles that are not flagged.
        </p>

        <h3>Controls</h3>
        <p>Left click - reveal a tile or tiles adjacent to it</p>
        <p>Right click - flag or unflag a tile</p>
